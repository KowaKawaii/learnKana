<h1>learnKana</h1>
<b>Japanese Fifty Sounds Chart Review Tool</b><br/><br/>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

The program allows you to review kana by typing its pronunciation,

it'll record kana you answered wrongly and give you a summary after you type 'stop'. 

I wrote it two years ago, now I rewrote it in Java for my uni project.

I would appreciate it if u give a star on the repo :)

<br/>

<h2>How to use it?</h2>

Assume you already have an IDE executes Java, you may use /src/Main.java to start the program.

Opening the whole repo folder with <b>intelliJ IDEA</b> helps you get started with the project more conveniently.

<br/>

<h2>Any release version?</h2>

Since we're still at the stage of development, we hardly ever pack a released version.

The released version will come up in the next months.

If you're interested in beta versions, plz don't hesitate to contact us: rinsukicc@gmail.com
