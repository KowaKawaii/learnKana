<h1>learnKana</h1>
<b>Japanese Fifty Sounds Chart Review Tool</b><br/><br/>

The program allows you to review kana by typing its pronunciation,

it'll record kana you answered wrongly and give you a summary after you type 'stop'.  

I wrote it two years ago, now I rewrote it in Java for my uni project.

I would appreciate it if u give a star on the repo :)
