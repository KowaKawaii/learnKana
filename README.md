## What is it?

Iâ€™d appreciate it if you could star the repo XDD

## Why develop?
Many existing kana reviewing programs prefer providing many pronunciations and making user choose one, instead of inputting directly.

As for me, I was struggling with these kana, so I wrote the command line version.

After a year, I rewrote it in Java and redesigned it with a more user-friendly interface.

## How to use?
You may need an IDE with Java support and JavaFX configured successfully.

Assuming you're using IntelliJ IDEA, kindly locate to <code>src/main/java/cc/rinsuki/learnkana/Home.java</code> to start.
